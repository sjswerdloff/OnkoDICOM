"""The pseudonymisation pepper and date jitter, kept in OnkoDICOM's configuration.

They live in ``~/.OnkoDICOM/pseudonymisation.toml``, as ``pepper`` and ``epoch_jitter`` in a
``[pseudo]`` table. A site that pseudonymised data with pymedphys, or with OnkoDICOM before
this file existed, has them in ``~/.pymedphys/config.toml``. When OnkoDICOM's file does not
exist, it is created with both values: each copied from pymedphys's file if it is there, so
the site keeps producing the same pseudonyms, and otherwise new. pymedphys's file is never
changed.

OnkoDICOM writes its file only to create it, never to change it (#74). Two OnkoDICOMs
starting at once both try to create it; the file appears whole or not at all, only one
succeeds, and the other uses the values that one wrote, so both use one pepper. A file that
exists without both values was changed outside OnkoDICOM, and is refused rather than
completed, since another OnkoDICOM could be completing it differently at the same moment.

Losing or replacing the pepper or jitter would silently change every pseudonym from then on,
so a configuration that exists but cannot be read, or is incomplete, stops pseudonymisation.
