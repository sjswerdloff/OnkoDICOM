Onko can be installed on Ubuntu 18.04, if you do not run Ubuntu you can 
try it on a virtual machine such as [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 
A premade Ubuntu virtual machine can be downloaded from 
[OSBoxes](https://www.osboxes.org/).

Onko requires virtualenv, python3-dev, gcc and git installed and can be
installed by running this command in the terminal.

`sudo apt install virtualenv git python3-dev gcc`

Clone the Onko repository

`git clone https://github.com/didymo/OnkoDICOM.git`

Enter the directory and create a virtual environment with a name of
your choice, in this case it's envOnkoDICOM.

cd OnkoDICOM

`virtualenv --python=python3 envOnkoDICOM`

Activate the virtual environment

`source envOnkoDICOM/bin/activate`

Install the requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
